## Getting Started

To get started with the frontend application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```
   cd user-management-app/frontend
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

## Features

- User Lobby: Displays a list of users fetched from the backend API.
- User Details: Shows detailed information about a selected user.
- Pagination: Allows navigation through multiple pages of users.
- Search Functionality: Filters users based on a search term.
- Loading States: Displays loading indicators while data is being fetched.
- Error Handling: Gracefully handles API request failures and displays user-friendly messages.

## Folder Structure

The folder structure of the frontend application is as follows:

## Technologies Used

- Next.js: A React framework for building server-rendered applications.
- TypeScript: A superset of JavaScript that adds static typing.
- Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for styling.
- Axios: A promise-based HTTP client for making API requests.

## API Integration

The frontend application interacts with the backend API to fetch user data. The API endpoints used are:

- `GET /api/users`: Fetches a list of users with pagination.
- `GET /api/users/{id}`: Fetches detailed information about a specific user.
- `GET /api/users/search?query={searchTerm}`: Searches for users based on a query.

## Styling

The application uses Tailwind CSS for styling. Global styles are defined in `globals.css`, and component-specific styles can be added directly within the components.

## Running the Application

To run the application in development mode, use the following command:

```
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server, and you can access the application at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have suggestions for improvements or new features, please open an issue or submit a pull request.
